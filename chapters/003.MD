# Change the commit message of a commit

## Setup your environnement

```
git checkout xxx
```

## Playground

This branch has 3 commits ahead from main


```
chore(name): add name
feat(config): add description
feat: add empty config.yaml file
```

the config.yaml file look like this

```
name: rebase
description: awweeesssssooommmee
```



## Goal
