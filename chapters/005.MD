# Split the commit message

## Setup your environnement

```
git checkout xxx
```

## Playground

This branch has 1 commit ahead from main


```
feat: add config.yaml + update README.MD
```



## Goal

- Edit the history in order to have 2 commits instead of 1

Split the commit in order to have this git log

```
feat: add config.yaml file
chore: update README.MD
```
